Simply Red embark on a 40th anniversary tour beginning in South America and expected to last most of the year. It’s been incredible to work on so many of their tracks during that time.

Mick seems to improve with age somehow, as seen in this recent US live performance of the classic ‘If You Don’t Know Me By Now’ on the Jimmy Fallon show. Still sounding fantastic.
