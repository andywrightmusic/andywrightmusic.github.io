Really happy to see the success of Gianna Nannini’s latest album, ‘Sei Nel L’Anima’ which we worked on together last year, here in London.

The album has performed outstandingly in her native Italy and beyond – and compliments the dramatized biopic of her early life ‘Beautiful Rebel’ now showing worldwide on Netflix.

Sananda plays his first UK show in 20 years at the Love Supreme Festival with a tour to follow. Love is Blind is also playlisted on Radio 2.
