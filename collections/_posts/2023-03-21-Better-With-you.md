With the release of the latest Simply Red album ‘Time’ fast approaching, it’s been great to see lead track ‘Better With You’ make Record of the Week at Radio 2 and the A-lists for both Radio 2 and Magic FM.

Production on ‘Time’ is now complete, (amazingly, my ninth record with the band!) and with a major tour beginning this summer it’s fantastic to see them continue to go from strength to strength.
