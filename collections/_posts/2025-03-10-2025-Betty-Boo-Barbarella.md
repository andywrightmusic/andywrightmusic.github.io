Great to see the release of Betty Boo’s new single ‘Barbarella’ – from her latest album ‘Rip Up The Rulebook.’ Really loved making this record with such a creative artist, a talent still full of twists and turns and new surprises. Gavin and I had a great time working on the album – and the single has been a growing success on radio all around the country.
