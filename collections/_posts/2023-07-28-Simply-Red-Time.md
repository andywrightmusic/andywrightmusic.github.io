‘Time’, the new Simply Red album, is now out on general release - and it was wonderful to see the record make the UK Top 10 while garnering fantastic reviews in both the broadsheets and the music press. A radio favourite already, with Album of the Week at Radio 2, as well as two Singles of the Week in ‘Better with You’ and ‘Just Like You,’ the latest collection of Simply Red songs could hardly have started out better.

I was at the Shepherd’s Bush Empire for launch night – Mick and the band were amazing – and clearly in prime shape for their latest major tour taking in Europe and beyond. The energy was incredible - even after all these years, the flame still burns so bright.
