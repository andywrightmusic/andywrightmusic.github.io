I used to say hi to Alison Clarkson AKA Betty Boo as we walked past each other at Metropolis Studios 20-odd years ago. Alison had a flat there and I had a studio. Almost 20 years later both Alison and I appeared in the same issue of Classic Pop magazine in the spring of 2019, and it prompted her husband and manager, Paul Toogood, to suggest he contact me with a view to collaborating on a song. Later that year, around September, we wrote our first song ‘Superstar’ and having enjoyed the process, decided that we’d write another the next week. The result was a song called ‘Right By Your Side’ which some 2 1/2 years later has just completed its 4th week on the Radio 2 Playlist! Our incredible chemistry in the studio helped us to create another 20 songs over the following year and the resulting album ‘Boomerang’ is promising to be somewhere near the no. 1 spot when it is released on the 14th of October 2022!
