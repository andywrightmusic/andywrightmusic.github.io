This project was a God send. Came at just the right time, Imelda needing someone to help complete her album and Gav and I are always hoping that something as good as this will come along. One of the real breakthrough albums of 2011 and Imelda established as a real deal artist with a great future we would be delighted to be part of. Personal highlight would be ‘Inside Out’, but my favourite song would have to be ‘Kentish Town Waltz’
