Seeing Keith return to England to record his second album with us was truly moving for me. Having first met Keith as a 19 year old in 2005 auditioning for my then label aspiration C2i (Counting to Infinity). So much water under the bridge which has seen Keith go to America, become the star of Celtic Thunder garnering a fan base of his own, recording his first album with David Foster and then returning to us the finished article. We recorded this album at a pace aided by Keith’s prowess as a musician, performer and songwriter. The results are beautiful and have brought Keith both success and plaudits across America.
