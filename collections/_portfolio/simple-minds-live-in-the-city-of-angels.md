Mixing Simple Minds ‘Live in the City of Angels’ release was a labour of love. The 2018 American Tour had been a huge success with the band packing out venues throughout the US and garnering critical acclaim with every show. Our job was to represent that with mixes, which is always a task given that there is so much atmosphere at a Simple Minds show. Added into this Jim and Charlie wanted a mix of all of the songs they performed on the tour, 28 from LA and a further 12 from other venues which was to make up a bonus disc. The results are phenomenal and attaining a top 10 result in the UK album charts was a wonderful achievement for a live album.
