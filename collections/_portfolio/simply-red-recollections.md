What a huge honour to be tasked with producing this recording – a collection of unforgettable songs. Among the great pleasures for me in revisiting the work has been to discover in even more detail material from the first four albums - which I wasn’t a part of at the time.  The songs speak for themselves, and they’re all now lodged in the minds of music lovers everywhere – so representing that in the best and most faithfull way was at the very top of our wishlist.

Mick writes: ‘When we recorded these songs, the band had just come off the road. I wanted to capture them while their song parts were still firmly etched into their consciousness. As a way of celebrating 40 years of Simply Red, we thought it apt to release these takes. Our producer Andy Wright set about capturing the atmosphere and sonics of the original recordings, and has done a magnificent job. This has enabled us to come full circle and celebrate our 40 years with you and hear and feel where we all are now. As ever, we give you all our very best.’
