No-one in my job would believe that they would have the opportunity to work with the vocals of Luciano Pavarotti, (surely one of, if not THE greatest singer that ever lived), backed up by Jeff Beck on lead guitar and supported by The Royal Philarmonic Orchestra. Well, that’s just what happened! I suppose it could be said that my securing of the job of re-making the legendary ‘Caruso’ for the album ‘Ti Adoro’ owed something to good timing and opportunism, but given the task I delivered something that I think is truly wonderful. It was for sure not the quickest piece of work I have ever completed but something I remain truly proud of.
