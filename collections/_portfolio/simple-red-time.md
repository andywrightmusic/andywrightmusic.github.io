<!-- With the release of the latest Simply Red album ‘Time’ fast approaching, it’s been great to see lead track ‘Better With You’ make Record of the Week at Radio 2 and the A-lists for both Radio 2 and Magic FM.

I first met Mick Hucknall in October 1994. I was given the job of programming drums on the Life album but very quickly we established a musical rapport which has seen me taking part in every album since then as producer. This amounts to 9 studio albums and 2 solo albums! It really has been a life’s work, but given our longevity, I have to say that Time is probably my favourite. 

The songs were spawned out of Mick’s lockdown experience and when it was safe to meet up I began going to his home studio to work one song at a time on what has become the finished record. 

With Radio 2 album of the week, both singles making record of the week and possibly the best press reviews we’ve ever had I am hugely proud of this album!
