My association with Macedonian born singer Toše Proeski began in the Spring of 2006. Tragically Toše died in a road accident on October the 16th 2007. I have since remained in contact with Toše’s family, completing our unfinished work (the resulting Album “The Hardest Thing’ a posthumous no. 1 record in all countries of former Yugoslavia). Please read my full tribute to Toše: an outstanding talent and a wonderful human being.
