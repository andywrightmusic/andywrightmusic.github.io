When I first got the inquiry from Jeff’s management I was bewildered as to why I would be getting the call as Jeff is a legend, and I’d not really had any experience of working with any guitar instrumentalists. Our first album, ‘You had it Coming’, was completed in just under 8 weeks, and the resulting ‘Best Rock Instrumental Performance’ Grammy for Jeff was just confirmation to me that we had made something truly great. Highlights from that album were many, but I suppose our cover of Nitin Sawney’s ‘Nadia’ would probably have to get the award if I had to give it. Our second album ‘Jeff’ also rewarded Jeff with a Grammy and featured on a number of major Hollywood movies.
