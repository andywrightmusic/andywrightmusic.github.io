Occasionally I get to work with my heroes, and as a Minds fan it doesn’t get much better than to be taking such a key role with the band’s forthcoming studio album. I’m flattered to be in the company also of such a legacy of former Simple Minds producers, including John Leckie, Steve Lillywhite, and Trevor Horn. Incredible for me that a band with such history are creating such a fresh and innovative new album and are the most humble, human and hysterical company! Myself and Gavin (my co-producer) are really excited about this album and are hoping both for hits and awards!
