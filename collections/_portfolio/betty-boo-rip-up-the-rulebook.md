After the completion of our first record together, ‘Boomerang,’ which did so well and which I thought was a great album – the thought of then trying to make something even better was a little daunting –  and at the time, I wasn’t sure it would be easy.

But as great as ‘Boomerang’ was, I think the follow up, ‘Rip Up The Rulebook,’ really did turn out even better.  With Alison you have a special and unique talent who brings something no one else does to a session - with a unique style of rapping, singing and lyrical approach. We wrote in intense bursts, developing ideas as we went, everything infused with her signature energy. The results shine brighter than ever. Betty Boo is really something.
