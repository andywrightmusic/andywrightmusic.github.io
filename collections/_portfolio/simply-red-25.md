It seems incredible to me that having began work with Simply Red on the 17th of October 1994, (I know this as it was my son Jonathan’s 1st birthday and I left for Manchester on that evening), I’m still working with the band today… 24 years later. In that time I have taken part in 10 albums and am currently collaborating on new material. Some of our creations are on this 25 year compilation along with many of the early tracks which were wonderfully produced by Stuart Levine.
