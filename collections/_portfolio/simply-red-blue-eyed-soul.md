Working once again with Mick on Simply Red’s 12th studio album (and my 8th), was a privilege and saw Mick embracing his position as one of the UK’s greatest soul singers. With a nod to soul legends such as James Brown and Sly Stone we set about recording a set of songs ‘live’ in the studio with an emphasis on grooves and arrangements that the band would love playing in front of a sell-out tour. With 2 Radio 2 hits, ‘Thinking of You’ A-listed and ‘Sweet Child’ both A-listed and achieving Record of the Week, and the album achieving Top 5 status once again, I was delighted to be part of yet another Simply Red success.
