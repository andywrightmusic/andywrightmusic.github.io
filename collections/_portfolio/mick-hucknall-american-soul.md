October 2012 saw the release of ‘American Soul’, Mick’s 2nd solo album and our 8th studio collaboration. The repertoire was largely garnered from Mick’s personal collection and from songs that were part of the soundtrack of his early life. It was particularly exciting to see every single achieve ‘Single of the Week’ status in addition to Ken Bruce making it Radio 2 ‘Album of the Week’. This in turn helped us achieve double Gold status in the UK.
