The end of 2022 saw the long-awaited release of a project close to my heart – Andreas Vollenweider’s new record ‘SlowFlow & Dancer’ 

Andreas is an outstanding musician, composer and global music figure – whose illustrious career spans five decades (and counting). A Grammy Award winner, film composer, and virtuoso harpist, highlights from his musical life have included sell-out performances the world over, Billboard Chart success, and notable collaborations with the likes of Bobby McFerrin, Carly Simon and Luciano Pavarotti.

Working with Andreas has been a meeting of minds - the melding of two different musical worlds. Out of it, we evolved one unified vision, and a work, I think, of real grace and beauty.  

It’s been a thrill to see SlowFlow & Dancer reach No1 in the New Age Chart on release, and No 8 in the Billboard Classical Crossover Chart. 

I can’t wait to see what the future holds…
