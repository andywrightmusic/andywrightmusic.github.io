Working with the legendary Echo and the Bunnymen with Gav was always going to be interesting. Our remit on this album was to help the band reinvent some of their classic tracks and also make 2 brand new songs to spearhead the bands promotion. I watched proudly from the record company table as the band performed 4 songs from the album on Jools Holland later last week particularly as Ian McCulloch sang the profoundly emotive version of their seminal song ‘The Killing Moon’ that we recorded with the band at Abbey Rd earlier this year.
