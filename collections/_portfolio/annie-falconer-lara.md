Introducing the wonderful Annie Falconer who is a singer songwriter from Northern Ireland. It has been a real pleasure working on Annie’s first album. Her songs have depth and intrigue and the soundscapes we have created together are mystical and inspiring. We released Annie’s first single Lara about 6 weeks ago and have been gaining new fans daily. Check it out on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/7tqgc4iaTwyf4omGByva8c?si=QDeKCEY7QZGMsx8mgMQyDw) AND on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/ZCWv08JuDoc)
